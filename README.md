Elena is powered by Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer
Entity(ALICE), which communicates with the patients, where the person using this
application can ask various questions and request this virtual chat-bot to prescribe
medicines along with the alternate natural ways of curing the diseases from which
the users are suffering from (for temporary aid).The working
mechanism is that this chat-bot identifies the choice of words used on the text
input provided by the users, through the patterns of words used, it retrieves the
respective cure, In addition to it, this application can also diagnose the disease using the
patient’s symptom history through Infermedica API and a local SQLite
database, In addition to this, Elena can also fetch data from various sites and read it to the user.
